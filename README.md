# My Showcases of Custom Visuals in Power BI with Deneb
Here is a collection of my showcases that I built in Power BI with Deneb using Vega and Vega-Lite libraries.
Feast your eyes on some of my best work.

# "East Australian Humpback Whales: Satellite Tag Data Shows Migratory Pathways, Feeding Grounds, and Possible Calving Areas"

I created this dataviz with Vega.

Here is the link for the pbix file for the PBI Deneb view:

# Unlocking Opportunity With Demand Spaces: Analyzing Consumer Functional Needs 
Utilizing survey results, I employed factor analysis and a matrix plot visualization in Power BI with Deneb custom visuals to discern distinct patterns in consumers' functional needs, leading to the creation of demand space descriptions enriched with representative titles and images reflecting nuanced survey insights.

I created this dataviz with Vega-Lite.

# WSJ Graphics - Payrolls and Unemployment
Here is my re-creation of the WSJ graphics about the monthly change of nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rate, and payrolls by sector based on US Labor Department data.

WSJ original article: [url link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/february-jobs-report-unemployment-rate-economy-growth-2023-e4b1d318?mod=article_inline).

Here is [the pbix file](https://github.com/isinkosemen/Power-BI-Deneb/blob/main/wsj-graphics-payrolls-unemployment/wsj-graphics-payrolls-unemployment.pbix).

# The Economist's Big Mac Index - Dot Plot Chart With Dynamic Text
I used Power BI slicers for Base Currency, and Index Period filter options. The rest of the custom visual was built in Deneb with Vega-Lite library.
I used params to change the color of the points and display the dynamic text when I hover and click on each one of them. The most challenging part 
of re-creating this visual was applying different font colors to different parts of the text. I had to break down the text to apply multiple colors, and 
I used the Monospace fixed-width font, so that I could get even spacing between each block of text.

Here is [the pbix file](https://github.com/isinkosemen/Power-BI-Deneb/blob/main/the-economist-big-mac-index/the-economist-big-mac-index-pbi.pbix).

# Information is Beautiful Creative Challange 2023
Here is the [Power BI interactive dashboard](https://isinkosemen.com/a_decade_of_electricity_production.html) I created for the 2023 "Information is Beautiful" creative challange. 

I used [Deneb pattern fills](https://deneb-viz.github.io/pattern-fills) to represent and highlight each source for the electricity production and their share between 2010 and 2020.

My interactive dashboard was included in the [interactive longlist](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/world-dataviz-prize-2023-interactives-longlist/) chosen by the jury.

# Turkey's Ring of Fire

This interactive Power BI Deneb custom visual shows the earthquakes which took place in Turkey between the 6th and 8th of February 2023. 

Everything was created by using the Vega-Lite library.

The red line shows the main fault lines in the region.

Here is the link for the [pbix file](https://github.com/isinkosemen/Power-BI-Deneb/blob/main/turkey-ring-of-fire/turkey-ring-of-fire.pbix).

I downloaded the GeoJSON data from [geojson-maps.ash.ms](https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/).

For earthquake locations I used [USGS earthquake data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). I also used «Plates and Faults layers v2» to get the coordinates of Turkey’s main fault lines from [usgs.maps.arcgis.com](https://usgs.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html).
